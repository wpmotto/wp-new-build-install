# Install WordPress New Build

Script for scaffolding and starting a new WP project. 

## Usage
- `git clone git@github.com:wpmotto/wp-new-build-install.git {your-project-directory}`
- `cd {your-project-directory}`
- `bash install.sh`

## How it Works
This shell script assembles and installs two repos for a quickstart:

1. https://github.com/wpmotto/wp-fresh-skeleton â€“ provides the replacement `wp-content` versioned directory with some sensible defaults in the `mu-plugins`
2. https://github.com/wpmotto/sage - our own flavor of Sage starter theme.
